# MUSHCode
This is where I am stashing my various MUSH code projects. Unless otherwise noted, they are designed for TinyMUX.

A lot of this code is built off of stuff Thenomain has done ( https://github.com/thenomain ).

PLEASE NOTE: This is designed to be dropped into Muxify ( http://muxify.musoapbox.net/editor.html ).
Muxify will not work on Chrome or Edge (for me, at least), so please use FireFox.

Hopefully it works.
