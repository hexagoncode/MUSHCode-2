Pose Order Machine by skew

(Note: this is written for people, like me, who barely understand what they're doing.)

This code uses the TinyMUX hook object. If you have +posebreak on your game, you probably already have this functioning. 
You will also need Myrddin's mushcron to clear out the idlers.

The basic functionality goes:
	* When a player poses (using 'pose' or '@em' or '"' or '\' whatever) the POM writes an attribute to the player's room.
	* After every pose, the code wipes the players previous pose attribute and writes a new one.
	* The code reads the room and creates a list of poses, then puts it in order. The oldest pose is whoever is now "up".
	* The code checks the player's attributes to see if they have poseorder on/off, then alerts the player as appropriate.
	* Every minute, mushcron checks all rooms. If the player is not there (left room, disconnected), they are wiped off the 
  pose order. If the player's last pose is older than X (default: 45 ) minutes, they are wiped off the pose order.
	* Additional functionality is here to exclude rooms, either from a global list (poseorder/exclude) or on a per-room basis 
  (poseorder/here off). The latter allows players to configure rooms they own.
	* Players can always use +poseorder to check the current poseorder.
	
Some thoughts:

	* At present, there is no way to look at Zone, room parent, mass attribute, etc. So if you set a room "OOC" in some manner, 
  there's no means to set that. It would not be hard at all to do, though. The first thing it does is check vs the list of 
  excluded rooms.
	* If you are the first person to pose in a room/scene, after the second person poses, you'll get pinged. If it's a multi-player 
  scene, you'll get pinged again, and again, and again, until it's back to your turn. It's obnoxious but I couldn't think of 
  any way to accommodate that.
	* Pose order sets loud, quiet, and off. Quiet = pemit to player. Loud = beep(). Not every client processes beep().
	* I have put in +poseorder/clear. This will emit to the room to let the room know who cleared it, but I think it's pretty 
  important to be able to clear. Say, someone says "idle for 30 minutes", the poseorder machine will not clear them until 45 
  minutes pass. This lets you do it manually.
	* So, why 45 minutes? I presented this to numerous players. If you're in a scene with 3 players, and each players takes 15
  minutes to pose (or longer), you'd be wiped off the list each round, if it were 30 minutes or 15 minutes. This can be 
  adjusted easily, though.

PLEASE NOTE: This is designed to be dropped into Muxify ( http://muxify.musoapbox.net/editor.html ).
Muxify will not work on Chrome or Edge (for me, at least), so please use FireFox.

=============================
== Setup ====================

Note: This assumes you have @hook object <ho> and CRON - Myrddin's mushcron. If these are named something different, you 
will need to adjust, or set them manually.

This first part creates attributes on you, and on your objects, so they have the dbref of other things stored. This way 
you can keep tinkering even if the object isn't in the room with you.
